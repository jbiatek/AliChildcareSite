### Nice words > #### Best Nanny Ever!> "In 2012 we had twin girls and we hired Ali to help with both the twins and our oldest daughter, who was only 2.  Life was pretty chaotic.  Ali made it possible for us to hold everything together!
>
> My favorite thing about Ali is that I can be myself with her.  We can talk about how to address the needs of the kids openly.  She is supportive of our parenting style and has great ideas of her own.  Our kids love Ali and it is such a relief to know that they are in good hands when we leave.  
> 
> The girls consider Ali part of our family and we couldn't be more grateful to her for sharing her many talents with us!  She is the perfect combination of kindness, silliness and dependability."

â€” Megan (Nanny family), 5 year old daughter and 3 year old twins> "Ali is very enthusiastic and brings a great energy with her every day to work.  She has developed a very loving and trusting relationship with our daughter who is always excited to see her when she comes over."â€” Lea (Nanny family), 2 year old daughter > "We've engaged Ali several times to watch our little one, and she's amazing. She's very intuitive and caring, and we always know that our baby is in good hands."â€” Cory (Occasional babysitting), 1 year old daughter > "I would definitely recommend Ali for the care of infant and toddler aged children. She has served as a date night babysitter for our two little girls. Finding a trustworthy and experienced caregiver was so important to us and Ali exceeded our initial expectations. She keeps detailed food and diaper logs while we are away, sends cute pics of the kiddos, and our toddler is just drawn to her bubbly personality."â€” Abby (Occasional babysitting), 2 year old and 3 month old daughter > "I would love to recommend Ali as a nanny and a date night sitter. I've known her for 14 years and she is a wonderful person. >> Ali is excellent with children! She is also a responsible nanny/babysitter who remains calm in any situation. She is a certified in first aid and CPR. She has also taken classes in child education. >> Ali loves to make learning fun and play games. She loves to do outings and makes every activity fun. She's great and I highly recommend her!"â€” Ginelle (Old co-worker and friend)More recommendations are still coming ðŸ˜€
